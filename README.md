This program is Freeware and the source code comes under the 
MIT Licence, but the program as a whole remains (c) Steve Shambles.

Head2Head is a desktop app written for Windows PC's but should work on MAC and Linux too (not tsted)
it contains every single English Premier league result from the day of the league's inception back in August 1992. I think that's over 23,000 matches.

You can choose a home team and an away team (all 50 teams that have ever played in the EPL are selectable) and H2H will show a table of all the matches played for that exact fixture. 

Note: H2H does not currently show the reverse fixture results, but you can just re-select the home and away teams the other way around if you want them.

At the bottom of the program you will see some statistics gleaned from the displayed results and a tentative prediction for the next time that fixture is to be played.

Of course this prediction is on based soley on history and cannot take into account current form, injuries, manager etc. so take the predictions with a pinch of salt,
but if I don't put a predictor of some sort in the program people will want one, so I did it!

You can save the resultant data as CSV or plain text by clicking the appropriate button.

You can quickly view edit or delete those saved files in your file browser,
if you got to the drop-down menu, top left of the program, you can select "open user saves folder".

This is a very early version of H2H.
I'm not sure if it is worth developing or not but I have done all the donkey work now so it should be fairly easy to add more stats and features, I think!

Though I am fully aware my programming leaves a lot to be desired (from a professional point of view) and probably only I can understand the spaghetti 
I created here (I have ADHD brain and it works different to most other people)
