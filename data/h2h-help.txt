--------------------------------------------------

Head2Head is a desktop app written for Windows PC's but should work on MAC and Linux too (not tested) it contains every single English Premier league result from the day of the league's inception back in August 1992 to March 14th 2023.

You can choose a home team and an away team (all 50 teams that have ever played in the EPL are selectable) and H2H will show a table of all the matches played for that exact fixture.

At the bottom of the program you will see some statistics gleaned from the displayed results and a tentative prediction for the next time that fixture is to be played.

Of course this prediction is on based solely on history and cannot take into account current form, injuries, manager etc. so take the predictions with a pinch of salt.

You can save the resultant data as a CSV file or plain text by clicking the appropriate button.

You can quickly view edit or delete those saved files in your file browser, if you got to the drop-down menu, top left of the program, you can select "open user saves folder".

Though I am fully aware my programming leaves a lot to be desired (from a professional point of view, I am a hobbyist not a pro, I do this for fun and probably only I can understand the spaghetti code I have created here 
I have an ADHD brain and it works different to most other people.
Sorry about that pro coders.
